	<p>I like cold nights, soft rock, Poetry, uber stylish people, vintage clothing, surprises, and of course good food. I think in my next life, I’ll probably be a true free spirit. My hair will most likely be a mohawk, I’ll have a few tiny tattoos and extra piercings, I’ll travel the world, read lots of books, write poetry, and make beautiful memories.
Next Life? I hope to still do all those things in this life!

I am a ball of paradoxes.
I crave adventures yet i can be a total recluse most of the time.

I Love Fashion
I’m inspired by creativity and uniqueness. I love people who stand out in a crowd, who have a sense of individuality. I believe that’s what fashion and personal style is all about. Infusing that little part of you and creating your own statement.

I Love Poetry and Words
There’s this unexplainable feeling I get when i read something extremely beautiful, be it poetry or Prose. I feel it within every inch of my being.

I Love the little things of life that make me smile regardless
Hugs, holding hands, little notes, flowers, time with family and friends, Laughter, doodles, beautiful memories..

I am learning every day to live and let live, to let go of the past and focus more on whats in front, to love, to laugh more, give more, be more, to be thankful for the little things, to be totally and unashamedly Me. But most importantly to allow the space between where I am and where I want to be to inspire and not terrify me.”

This is my little corner on the web to share my Personal style, Fashion inspirations, Med school and Modelling tid-bits and random musings.
Please come on in and i hope you stay!</p>
